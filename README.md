ScheduleDeck

By Alyssa Foglia, Diego Carstens, Matthew Hibbs, Tan Nguyen


A web application that utilizes the Canvas API to compile a list of “Things To Do” based on the user’s class assignments priority. Priority is determined by assignments due date. Priority can also be manually set by the user. In addition, the application can alsoact as a scheduling application, so users can add their own schedule outside of canvas. The user will also be able to create a personal account and login to access their ‘Things To Do’ list.

The team will build a web application that helps students schedule the tasks they need to complete for their classes. The programming languages the team will use are Python and JavaScript. The tools that will be used are the Canvas REST API and a database program, MongoDB, in addition to a backend framework such as Flask/Django with a simple HTML/CSS frontend.

The challenge statement the team is addressing is #3, a student resource that will assist in the quality and delivery of education through online learning due to the pandemic. Our project contributes to addressing the challenge statement by allowing students to be more aware of what assignments they need to complete. Our project acts as a method for streamlining education by helping students with time management, which may ultimately lead to more students properly completing assignments and learning the material without having to rush through them.
