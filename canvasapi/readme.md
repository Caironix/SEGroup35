## Example of using the canvas api with the Python wrapper class:

The main.py file is an example script that calls the wrapper class's functions and shows you how to get course and assignment data for a user

The web app will only need access to the wrapper.py file and the Django backend will call the functions in the same way the main.py file does from the wrapper.py file to get user data.
